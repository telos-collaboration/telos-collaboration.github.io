---

The TELOS Collaboration has a strong commitment to open science.
We aim to make all products of and processes used in our research openly available.

## Data

For all new peer-reviewed articles released,
we aim to provide underpinning data.
This includes the raw data,
as transferred from high-performance computing systems,
and processed output data,
as shown in publications.

For conference proceedings,
we may refer to a previous or forthcoming peer-reviewed article
for the associated data.

To find our releases,
look for links marked "Data" in our [publications](/publications).

## Workflows

For all new peer-reviewed articles released,
we aim to provide a fully reproducible analysis workflow.
This takes raw data,
as transferred from high-performance computing systems,
and outputs the processed data, plots, and tables,
as included in publications.

For conference proceedings,
we may refer to a previous or forthcoming peer-reviewed article
for the associated workflow.

To find our releases,
look for links marked "Workflow" in our [publications](/publications).

## Field configurations

We aim to share our gauge ensembles openly in the near future,
via the [UKLFT][uklft] Regional Grid of [the International Lattice Data Grid][ildg].

If in the mean time you would like access to
the gauge ensembles supporting our published work,
please get in touch.

## Software

We make use of the following community software in our work:

- [Grid][grid], developed by Peter Boyle and collaborators
- [HiRep][hirep],
  developed by Claudio Pica and collaborators.
  We specifically use [a fork][hirep-spn] adapted to work with symplectic groups,
  developed in house
  and optimised by Research Software Engineers
  at the Swansea Academy of Advanced Computing.
- [Hadrons][hadrons],
  developed by Antonin Portelli and collaborators.

We are grateful to the contributions of the development communities of these codebases,
without which our research would not be possible.

## Literature

We make preprints of our work available via [arXiv][arxiv].
We aim to publish all our work as open access in open access or hybrid journals;
additionally,
postprints of our work are available via
Swansea University's [Cronfa][cronfa] institutional repository.
